# About Me

<img src="https://ydchn86.github.io/aniya_1.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Renhe Jimu**.<br>

I am currently working as a clerical worker in a unit in Zhejiang Province. I graduated from a Shanghai university in 2024 with a major in medicine and engineering. I am not very good at academics. Although I have been exposed to many fields of engineering and medicine, I have not specialized in any one field. In the process of work, various research plans have emerged like mushrooms after rain, so I realized that I regretted not having enough knowledge when I needed it. I started learning new knowledge in the summer of 2025.<br>

In the past, I studied embedded systems, ARM languages, traditional machinery, circuits, statistics and other knowledge taught in school, and in my spare time, I learned languages ​​such as ssh, routers, C and Python. I learned a lot of things, and as mentioned above, I didn't learn well, and now I suffer from it. Due to work needs, I will continue to study in depth in various parts to develop some kind of equipment to facilitate my current work.<br>

Due to professional reasons, the development of interdisciplinary subjects is limited, and the same is true for employment. In today's environment, it is also very difficult to find job opportunities. Nowadays, engineering students work in civilian jobs, and I can only smile bitterly. God will take his own way, and no one will be spared by heaven. But it doesn't matter. My high school life taught me to learn to study independently, so I will continue to study until I die. (Why don't you study hard in college? There are difficulties, but it is not appropriate to say it publicly.)<br>

Finally, if you have any questions that I can assist you with, or if you are willing to share valuable suggestions with me, I welcome communication and cooperation with you. You can contact me via email **YDCHN86[at]gmail.com**, or add me via WeChat **wxid6295yd** (please be sure to indicate your purpose, thank you!)**<br>
